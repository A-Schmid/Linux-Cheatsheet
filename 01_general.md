## General

The basic syntax for commands is ```COMMAND [OPTIONS] [INPUTS] [OUTPUT]```.

Options are generally marked with a hyphen (short form) or double hyphen (long form).
Short form options can be combined, e.g. ```ls -l -a``` is the same as ```ls -la```.

Type ```man [COMMAND]``` to open the manual page for the specified command.
It contains a general description of the command and all available options.
Press Q to quit the manual.

Most commands have a ```--help``` parameter which displays a summary of the manual page.
